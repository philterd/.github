# Welcome!

Welcome to **philterd**! We specialize in software and techniques for managing sensitive information in text and documents.

Our open source project [phileas](https://github.com/philterd/phileas) is a PII/PHI redaction engine. It was created to identify and manipulate (redact, anonymize, etc.) sensitive information in text. Phileas powers our commercial software products [Philter](https://www.mtnfog.com/products/philter/) and [Phirestream](https://www.mtnfog.com/products/phirestream/). We have open source clients for Philter and Phirestream in a few languages.

Commercial support and custom NLP models are available from the [Philterd](https://www.philterd.ai) team.

You can reach out to us at hi@philterd.io for questions or just to say hi.
