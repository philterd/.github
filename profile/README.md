# Welcome!

Welcome to **philterd**! We specialize in software and techniques for redacting and managing sensitive information in text and documents.

Our open source project [phileas](https://github.com/philterd/phileas) is an open source redaction engine that finds and redacts (encrypt, anonymize, etc.) sensitive information like PII and PHI in text. Phileas powers [Philter](https://www.github.com/philterd/philter), an open source, API-based, turnkey redaction solution.

Commercial support is available from the [Philterd](https://www.philterd.ai) team.

Feel free to reach out to us at hi@philterd.ai.
